# Basic Calculator

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** - For building the user interface and handling state management.
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling and ensuring a responsive, modern UI.
- **Node.js** - For backend operations such as logging calculations or storing data.

## Project Difficulty Level
**Hard**

## Project Description
The **Basic Calculator** project is a web-based application that allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface with responsive design for smooth interaction across different devices.

## Features
### User Interface
- Modern and responsive UI designed with Tailwind CSS.
- Buttons for digits (0-9) and basic operators (+, -, *, /).
- Special buttons for "Clear" and "Equals" functions.

### Functionality
- Users can enter numerical values and perform real-time calculations.
- Supports fundamental arithmetic operations.
- Proper handling of decimal points.
- Implements order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS).

### Error Handling
- Prevents division by zero errors.
- Ensures smooth and error-free calculations.

### Additional Features (Optional)
- Advanced mathematical functions (square root, percentage, etc.).
- History tracking of previous calculations.
- Persistent storage using backend (Node.js & database).

## How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** installed on your system.

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-app.git
   cd calculator-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application should now be accessible at **http://localhost:5173/**.



## Use Cases
- **Basic Arithmetic Calculations** - A quick and easy way to perform simple math operations.
- **Educational Purposes** - Helps beginners learn front-end and back-end integration.
- **Portfolio Project** - Showcases proficiency in React, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js.

## Conclusion
This **Basic Calculator** project demonstrates how to create an interactive and functional calculator using modern web technologies. It is a great starting point for learning state management in React and styling with Tailwind CSS. Future improvements can include **scientific functions, history tracking, and cloud-based storage** to enhance usability.
